# bt-alt-rules
Draft for alternative (simpler/quicker) rules for Battletech.

# things to solve
- how many weapons hit??? 1xppc+1xlrm20 vs 12xmedlaser???
- hit zones???

# order of turns
## alternative 1
 - every mech rolls initiative: d20 + initiative skill + commander bonus
 - highest initiative goes first
### unresolved
 - going last could be desirable?
 - bonus based on mech type (light +2, medium +1, heavy 0, assault -1)?
 - commander bonus?
	
## alternative 2
 - each team rolls initiative: d20 + commander initiative skill
 - highest initiative chooses to go first or last
 - mechs alternate turns
### unresolved
 - how to alternate with unequal mechs on teams? (rules should already exist)

# taking turns
every mech gets one move action and one fire action
 - can be taken in any order
 - each action must be completed separately (no partial moves)
 - can make a second move action instead of firing
 - move can be zero hexes (mech still counts as moving inside hex)
 - moving creates no penalty
 - only one move action can be a jump
 - effects of firing a resolved before another mech takes a turn

### unresolved
 - double move a good idea?
 - does move generate heat?
 - ability to return fire?
	
# evasion value
each mech has an evasion value (like AC in D&D):
 - base 10
 - + (walking speed - 4)
 - light +2, medium +1, heavy 0, assault -1
 - modified by pilot skill (-1? to +4?)
this is the base to hit the mech on d20
 - example: locust(light) 10+(8-4)+2 = 16
 - example: wolverine(medium) 10+(5-4)+1 = 12
 - example: atlas (assault) 10+(3-4)-1 = 8
if the mech looses walking speed due to damage, evasion value 
is adjusted immediately

### unresolved
 - modifications to hit chance (woods, weapon range, cover)?
 - roll every weapon?
 - weapon ranges?
 - should rolling higher than required give a benefit?
 - using modifiers or D&D style advantage/disadvantage
